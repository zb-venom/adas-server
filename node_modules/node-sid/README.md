# node-sid

Simple id generator for node. shortid is much more powerful, but was far overpowered for my needs. So if anyone can need this - here's how it works

##installation
```sh
 $ npm install node-sid
```
### Usage
```sh
 require('node-sid')().create()
 'r8j4jX'
```
creates a 6 digit id, looking like <b>r8j4jX</b>

```sh
 require('node-sid')().create('PRE')
'PRE_1RK9wZ'
```
creates a 6 digit id with a prefix

```sh
 require('node-sid')().create('PRE',8)
'PRE_87bgPYE7'
```
creates a 8 digit id with a certain length and prefix

###Instance Options
```sh
 require('node-sid')({
   seed:'0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTOVWXYZ',
   len:6,
   headerField:'x-node-sid'
 })
```
seed: specifies the chars to use for the id - please be aware that the lesser chars you use the higher the possibility for dups will be. Default are Numbers and upper+lower Alphas.
len: length (same as if specified in the create call)
headerField: special handling when used as an express middleware when used on proxies. 

###Using it as an express middleware
```sh
 app.use(require('node-sid')().middleware);
```
this will mark every request with an additional http-header x-node-sid (or the one you specified in the options). Mainly this is thought to be used in proxy-like services in distributed environments. The Middleware will append "their" id to it, forming a unique global request-id which looks like <b>FIRST_SvTMpu.SECOND_LR9qfp.THIRD_0Jujaw</b>
